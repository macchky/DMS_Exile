## To install:
Put the pre-packed PBO in your ```@ExileServer\addons\``` directory. It should be alongside ```exile_server``` and ```exile_server_config```.

### NOTE: It is heavily suggested that you use [The Unofficial Exile v0.9.19 SP3](http://www.exilemod.com/topic/169-download-link-for-banana-sp3/?do=findComment&comment=961) with DMS, as it will resolve several issues. [Also look at the first part of this comment](http://www.exilemod.com/topic/61-dms-defents-mission-system/?do=findComment&comment=920)

If you are using infiSTAR and want to keep ```_CGM = true;```, then set ```_UMW = true;```, and add ```DMS_MissionMarkerCircle```, ```DMS_MissionMarkerDot``` to ```_aLocalM```,
so your ```_aLocalM``` would look like:

```
    _aLocalM = ["DMS_MissionMarkerCircle","DMS_MissionMarkerDot"];
```
## IF YOU ARE UPDATING YOUR DMS FROM BEFORE THE 5th OF SEPTEMBER, PLEASE READ BELOW:
The crate loot system has undergone an improvement. You can now define loot values for different crates for the same mission, or none at all!
HOWEVER: This requires you to change the organization of the crate in the mission.

Previously, _missionObjs was defined with the format:
```
[
	[_cleanupObj1,_cleanupObj2,...,_cleanupObjX],
	[_crate,_vehicle1,_vehicle2,...,_vehicleX],
	_crate_loot_values
]
```


Now you must define it as:
```
[
	[_cleanupObj1,_cleanupObj2,...,_cleanupObjX],
	[_vehicle1,_vehicle2,...,_vehicleX],
	[
		[_crate1,_crate_loot_values1],
		[_crate2,_crate_loot_values2]
	]
]
```

Please refer to the current default missions if you are unsure. The Bauhaus truck mission shows an example of spawning 2 crates.

## Optional:


### To modify the config:
* Download the a3_dms folder
* Edit the config.sqf to your preferences.
* Pack the a3_dms folder with a PBO tool (**PBO Manager**, Eliteness, or Arma 3 Tools suite)
* Follow the "To install:" steps using the PBO you just created instead of the pre-packed one.


### ~~HEADLESS CLIENT:~~
![Warning](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Achtung.svg/200px-Achtung.svg.png)

**Headless Client is currently broken in ArmA as of the 4th of September, do not use it as it WILL crash your server.**

~~Add this code to the TOP of your initPlayerLocal.sqf~~ 

```
if (!hasInterface && !isServer) then
{
	1 spawn
	{
		waitUntil {player==player};
		DMS_HC_Object = player;
		publicVariableServer "DMS_HC_Object";
	};
};
```

## Changelog:
#### September 14, 2015 (11:00 PM CST-America):
* NEW CONFIG VALUES: DMS_AIVehCleanUpTime, DMS_MinWaterDepth, DMS_Bandit_Vehicle_MoneyGain, DMS_Bandit_Vehicle_RepGain.
* Changed default value of DMS_Bandit_Static_MoneyGain to 75, DMS_Bandit_Static_RepGain to 15.
* NEW FUNCTION: DMS_fnc_SpawnAIVehicle.
* You can now spawn AI in vehicles.
* Improved cleanup method for AI in static guns.
* Working on improving OnKilled EH for AI in vehicles.
* FindSafePos should no longer check for parameters if the corresponding blacklist radius is set to 0.


#### September 13, 2015 (11:45 PM CST-America):
* Updated parameter type for "DMS_dynamicText_Size", as well as commented out description for "dynamicTextRequest". Will try to work on functionality for it soon.
* Improved cleaning of AI units. There may still be issues, specifically with launchers. If there are, please let me know, and test it. The more info I have, the quicker it can be fixed :)


#### September 13, 2015 (1:00 AM CST-America):
* New config value: ```DMS_AI_WP_Radius_base``` . Tiny waypoint radius for "base defence".
* New mission: "mercbase". Known issue: Stuff gets messed up when the mission spawns on a steep slope. Blame BIS for breaking "BIS_fnc_findSafePos" :P
* Added Taviana map safe pos params. (thanks JamieKG!)
* New functions: "DMS_fnc_CalcPos" and "DMS_fnc_ImportFromM3E".
* You can now import bases from Maca's awesome M3 Editor! Simply create the file under the "objects" folder, then call "DMS_fnc_ImportFromM3E"! Refer to the new "mercbase" mission as an example.
* "DMS_fnc_ImportFromM3E" supports static position (make sure you pass [0,0,0] as the second parameter), relative position, as well as bank/pitch. In addition, you get parameter parsing, just like any other DMS function, so if you're messing around with stuff and make a mistake, it will tell you ;)
* You can now specify which gun that an static AI spawns with.


#### September 12, 2015 (1:30 AM CST-America):
* Added Esseker map safe pos params. (thanks Flowrider!)


#### September 11, 2015 (8:30 PM CST-America):
* NEW CONFIG VALUES: ```DMS_GodmodeCrates``` and ```DMS_CrateCase_Sniper```. DMS_GodmodeCrates is pretty self-explanatory :P
* NEW FEATURE FOR "DMS_fnc_FillCrate": You can now define "crate cases" in the config (such as "DMS_CrateCase_Sniper"). Passing the "crate case" name (such as "Sniper") will make the crate spawn with the exact gear defined in the config. Refer to the testmission.sqf (line 80) and "DMS_CrateCase_Sniper" config for an example.
* Spawned vehicles will now be LOCKED and INVINCIBLE until the mission is completed.
* Spawned vehicles spawn with 100% fuel.
* "Fixed" some cases where killing from a mounted gun would reset your money/respect (maybe).
* Fixed some spelling errors and incorrect names in some of the mission messages/markers.
* Fixed DMS_fnc_FindSafePos for Bornholm. If you have any issues with custom maps, please let us know.
* Fixed backpack spawning on the ground behind an AI unit that was supposed to get a launcher.


#### September 10, 2015 (6:00 PM CST-America):
* NEW CONFIG VALUES: ```DMS_MarkerPosRandomization```, ```DMS_MarkerPosRandomRadius```, and ```DMS_RandomMarkerBrush```
* With the above configs, you can randomize the marker positions in a random position around the actual mission center.
* You can also "force" DMS_fnc_CreateMarker to randomize (or not randomize) the marker position with optional boolean parameter of index 3.
* Changed the default (non-randomized) circle marker "brush". It should be a solid circle.
* Created new functions ```DMS_fnc_SelectOffsetPos``` and ```DMS_fnc_SelectRandomVal```
* Adjusted a couple functions to use them.
* Fixed ```DMS_fnc_IsNearWater```.


#### September 9, 2015 (10:00 PM CST-America):
* Added static AI! The "donthasslethehoff" mission has them included by default. :D
* New config values: ```DMS_Bandit_Static_MoneyGain``` and ```DMS_Bandit_Static_RepGain```.
* Future-proofed ```DMS_fnc_OnKilled```. As a result, "DMS_BanditMoneyGainOnKill" is now ```DMS_Bandit_Soldier_MoneyGain```, and "DMS_BanditRepGainOnKill" is now ```DMS_Bandit_Soldier_RepGain```.
* Added config value ```DMS_ai_disable_ramming_damage```. Check the comment for more info :)
* Removed config value "DMS_ai_static_skills"
* Randomized vehicle spawn position for "cardealer" mission.
* NOTE: If you use custom ```DMS_fnc_SpawnAISoldier``` calls, you will have to update your calling parameters! Make sure you add "Soldier" at the end of the array, or before ```_customGearSet``` if you're using it!
* Added ```_launcher``` option for ```_customGearSet``` in ```DMS_fnc_SpawnAISoldier```. NOTE: This changes the order of the gearset parameters for the AI. ```_launcher``` is between ```_items``` and ```_helmet```! Use empty string ```""``` if you don't want any launcher on the AI unit.


#### September 8, 2015 (11:00 PM CST-America):
* AI Bodies should now be properly cleaned when run over (if configured to do so with ```DMS_remove_roadkill``` and ```DMS_remove_roadkill_chance```).
* Added config option ```DMS_credit_roadkill```. If set to true, players will get poptabs/respect for running over AI. Default: false.
* Fixed giving poptabs/respect for killing AI from vehicles. Passengers and mounted gunners should properly receive poptabs/respect when they kill AI.
* Launchers should now be reliably removed from AI bodies that have them.


#### September 7, 2015 (7:00 PM CST-America):
* AI bodies should now be cleared if configured to do so with "DMS_clear_AI_body" and "DMS_clear_AI_body_chance".


#### September 5, 2015 (1:00 AM CST-America):
* Created new function "DMS_fnc_IsPlayerNearby" to replace "ExileServer_util_position_isPlayerNearby".
* Fix IR Strobes spawning inside the crate and not appearing.


#### September 4, 2015 (11:20 PM CST-America):
* Improved crate handling by DMS. You can now spawn multiple crates with different loot, or simply no crates at all. (REQUIRES FILE CHANGES FOR EACH MISSION)
* Accounted for case sensitivity in switch-do statements for SpawnAISolder.
* Decreased default amount of money/respect gain on AI kills (Used to be 100 poptabs and 25 respect, it is now 50 poptabs and 10 respect)
* Define functions in config.cpp. This resulted in ALL FILES being changed to some degree.
* Fixed spawning Binocs and Rangefinders/Designators on AI.
